## Jenkins Java Manual

#### Things to be done

- Know what is Java Generics , you might need some more material in one of the ten books.
- Know what is Jenkins Pipeline, Job, Run, Build, Folder and View , List the difference of them
- Understand the Jenkins Core function.
- Understand Jenkins Plugin Class Hierarchy.

#### Questions

- what is javadoc
  - it is a documentation generator out of comments.
- why every java class can have a main function ? What is main function in Java and how does it work ?
- what does public implies in Java
- what is the behaviour in C++ of private data? Composite instead of inheritance ? Why the author say  public inheritance and private inheritace
- how to use Java interface attributes? in what case will we use java interfaces ?  Also notice that Java doesn't support multi-inheritance but can implement multiple interfaces.
- what is Java generics ? How do we achieve Java generics ? 
- What is nested class used for in Java ? Static or non-static ? 
- pay some attention to Java generics ! 
- NEXT
- can java superclass reference variable visit subclass only attributes? Answer is no but how to differ with polymorphism ? 
- compare C++ private inheritance is-a relation with Java extend is-a relationship
- run is a generic class, then what is JobT ? any generic programming in it ?  Is it an interface or something else ? 
- how to instantiate a class at declaration ? 
- does Java have other form of loop ? like a in list_a or something similiar
- how to add list in a class
- Java using map
- need to know how to build a collection using another collection
- what is the difference between built-in types (primitives) and Integer things?
  - We can ask why generics in Java doesn't work with primitive types ? Because generics in Java are entirely compile-time construct. And anything used as generics has to be convertable to Object and primitives are not. 
- How to explain Java interfaces? What is reference type in Java ?
- Can Java interface have private methods? Any examples or practical meaning of that ?
- what does it mean by "if a class does not perform all the behaviors of the interface, the class must declare itself as abstract" ? Can a class implement some of the methods of a interface? 
- what does it mean by "Checked exceptions should not be declared on implementation methods other than the one declared by the interface method or subclasses of those declared by the interface method"
  - remember an interface can extend another interface ! 
- Is vector used often in Java ? 
- what is hashtable and dictionary ? 
- you need to read more about Java generics ! 
- what is the bounded type in generics and other things ? Very curious about that.
- where is transient field stored when an object is serialized.
- what is class T extends Able<T> ? 
- how is Java override decorator defined? How is decorator defined ?
- what is ? in a generic type variable ? 
- why is class Disk extends Able<Disk> ? Why we can do this ?
- How to see the source code of a lib imported in Intellij ? How trace to the root of the code?
- what is the decorator used in methods rather than classes?
- basically the @ is not decorator in java. It is called Annotation ! Then what is an annotation ? Very interesting !
