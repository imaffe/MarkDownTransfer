#### 1. kfsGate/kfsWebservice/

Django use **views** to handle requests, and these request urls are mapped to a function in a python file. (Mapping was done through the **urls.py**). Files under kfsWebservice handle with request come from agent and client and other places, and place them in different files.

- Ques : changeMMR() ?
- Ques : is the changeMMR() been modified to Django Database?
- Ques : why it is a second level agent service API?

- Ques : what is JPush ?
