## Networking

#### packet switches

calculate the chain delay with N routers

- queue delays and packet loss
- forwarding table and routing protocols
- circuit switching : reserve resource between two end systems
- IGNORE : details of two switches
- networks of networks
  - Points of Presence, multi-homing, peering, Internet exchange points
  - access ISP : bottom level ISP
  - content provider networks
- delay, loos and throughput in packet-switch networks
  - processing delays : microseconds
  - queue delay : micro to milli
  - transmission
  - propagation
- IGNORE: details of the delays
- IGNORE : packet loss and all remaining part in delay and loss

#### protocol layers and service models

- how to understand the 5 protocol layers
  - pass
- OSI model
- network security
- IGNORE : history of computer networking 

#### application layer

- c/s , b/s, p2p architecture 
- definition of client and server (differentb)
- four considerations choosing transport level protocol !
- TCP : offer congestion-control mechanism
- timing and through put can be satisfied using implementation.
- application-layer protocol defines how they passage message to each other ! 
- Web and HTTP
  - Non-persistent and persistent connections
  - Message Formats
  - Cookies
  - IGNORE : delay calculation of caching 
  - CDN : content distribution networks
  - Conditional GET
- FTP
- SMTP
  - sime details of SMTP
  - POP3 : email access protocals : no cross session state saved 
- DNS : Internet's Directory Service : UDP using port  53
  - so basically all daily hosts has DNS client !
  - QUES : what is canonical hostname ? hostname createed according to rulesÔºÅ like standard name !
  - 3 main function : most important to me : load distribution
  - EXTRA : read the other operation on DNS on page 133
  - DNS caching : hierarchy DNS server 
    - recursive and iterative
  - DNS record and messages
- P2P
  - BitTorrent Protocols
  - IGNORE:  compare c/s and p2p scalability
  - IGNORE : DHT detail of the last 2 points
